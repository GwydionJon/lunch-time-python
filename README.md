Welcome to Lunch Time Python - an event series organized by the [Scientific Software Center](https://ssc.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de) at Heidelberg University.

## What it is

Python is a very popular - maybe even *the* most popular - programming language among scientific software developers. One of the reasons for this success story is the rich standard library and the rich ecosystem of available (scientific) libraries. To fully leverage this ecosystem, developers need to stay up to date and explore new libraries. *Lunch Time Python* aims at providing a communication platform between Pythonistas to learn about new libraries in an informal setting. Sessions take roughly 30 minutes, one library is presented per session and the code will be made available afterwards. Come by, enjoy your lunch with us and step up your Python game!

## Sessions

These are the currently planned sessions of Lunch Time Python:

* [Session 1](lunchtime1/README.md): October 29th 2021, 12 pm: [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/).

Here is a list of past sessions which you can reproduce in a Cloud environment by clicking the [Binder](https://mybinder.org) links below:

## Registration

Registration for Lunch Time Python sessions is not required. You can still register using [this form](https://ssc.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/form/lunch-time-python-registration) to

* give us a better idea about the potential audience and what libraries we should present.
* make us send you a reminder the day before the session

If you want to suggest a library for presentation, you can also send an [email to the SSC developers](mailto:ssc@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de)

## Licensing

The example codes are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ssciwr/lunch-time-python) and are provided under the permissive MIT license giving you a lot of freedom to reuse and redistribute the code in your projects!

# Ideas for libraries to present

I can imagine presenting the following libraries (list is constantly updated).
I am unsure which of the below categories is most interesting to the target
audience.

If you see this and have additional ideas, please open a Pull Request against
this repository.

## Standard Library

* argparse
* contextlib
* csv
* functools
* itertools
* logging
* os.path & pathlib
* typing

## Utility Libraries

* beautifulsoup
* click
* ipywidgets
* jinja2
* numba
* peewee
* pyaml
* pyrsistent
* pytest
* ~requests~

## Scientific Libraries

The risk with these is: They might be either already well-known or irrelevant to people depending on the domain they are working in. Another issue is that many of these are huge frameworks that can only presented very minimally in the given time frame.

* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
* scipy
* scrapy
* ~sympy~
* tensorflow
